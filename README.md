# Rainfall-Forecast
We are trying to provide a model that predicts rainfall from the previous day. The model is trained on a dataset containing 145,460 rows (examples) and 23 columns (features). We trained three different models to choose the best one. Before training, we encountered problems that required pre-processing on our data.
